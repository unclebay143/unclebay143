## ðŸ‘‹ Hey there

![Readme Cover](https://github.com/unclebay143/unclebay143/cover.jpg)

My name is Ayodele Samuel Adebayo, and I am a Front-end developer.

Currently, I am currently a Fellow at TIIDELab a software development initiative in Abuja as a Junior Front-end Developer .

Solving problems with my software development skills is what moves me and keeps me in a constant search for knowledge.

I have proficiency in JavaScript, HTML, CSS and packages / libraries such as:
- ReactJS
- Bootstrap
Also:
- Django
- Python

The tools come and go, but some concepts are kept, that's where I keep my efforts.

I love to talk about algorithm, automations, design patterns, code patterns, and things that make me a better developer.
